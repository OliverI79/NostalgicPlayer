Position list:

Each position contains 2 bytes.

Command byte:
  xx = Number of times to play track
  40 = Loop list (no data byte)
  4x = Set loop position to current position and count to x (no data byte)
  fd = Start master volume fade
  fe = End of list and stop playing
  ff = End of list

Data byte:
  If command is fe or ff, it is a new start position
  If command is fd, it is the fade speed
  Else it is a track number

Each track position consist of at least 2 bytes.

xx (yy) zz

xx = ff = End of track
     If bit 7 is set, yy is read and used. Else yy is skipped.
     If bit 6 is set, envelope is resetted/stopped?
     Else it is a speed counter / hold counter
yy = If positive, set as instrument number. Negative means portamento.
zz = Note


Envelope:

Each point consist of 3 bytes.

xx yy zz

xx = Ticks to wait. If >= 0xc0, set new position to xx & 3f
yy = Volume increment value (can be negative)
zz = Number of times to process the same point
