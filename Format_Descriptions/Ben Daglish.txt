When playing a note, the player uses an instrument number set on the channel.
This number is between 0 and 7. This number is then used to lookup in a
mapping table to find the sample number to use. This mapping table is
initialized to use the first 8 samples.


Position list

V1 player:

00-7F    = Track number
80-BF    = Loop track by <effect> & 1F
C0-C7 xx = Update instrument mapping table at index <effect> & 7 to sample xx
FE xx    = Transpose
FF       = End of position list

V2 player:

00-C7    = Track number
C8-EF    = Loop track by <effect> & 1F
F0-F7 xx = Update instrument mapping table at index <effect> - F0 to sample xx
FD xx    = Start master volume fade. xx = fade speed
FE xx    = Transpose
FF       = End of position list


Track data

00-7E xx yy = Note. xx is how many ticks to wait until reading next track command. yy is only available on some players and only if xx = 0. yy is the same as xx, but the behaviour of SetupSample() changes
7F xx       = Wait. xx is how many ticks to wait until reading next track command
80-88       = Use instrument by <effect> & 7
89-BF       = Set flag by <effect> & F
C0 xx yy zz = Portamento 1. xx = start delay, yy = duration, zz = delta number of nodes
C1          = Stop portamento 1
C2 xx yy zz = Volume fade. xx = speed, yy = duration, zz = increment value
C3          = Stop volume fade
C4 xx       = Portamento 2. xx = duration
C5          = Stop portamento 2
C6 xx yy zz = Global volume slide. xx = start value, yy = speed, zz = increment value
C7          = Stop global volume slide
FF          = End of track data


Instrument info:

 0 4 Offset to sample data
 4 4 Offset to sample data where loop starts
 8 2 Length in words (one shot)
 A 2 Length of loop in words
 C 2 Volume
 E 2 Volume fade speed
10 2 Portamento duration
12 2 Portamento increment value
14 2 Vibrato depth
16 2 Vibrato increment value
18 2 Note transpose
1A 2 Fine tune Period
