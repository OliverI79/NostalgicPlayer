Track data:

Each track consist of 2 bytes pair, which are:

0 Block number
1 Transpose value

If both bytes are 0xff, it means the track ends. The next two bytes & 0x7ff is the new position in the track.


Block data:

Each block are 64 bytes long. It only contains note information for a single channel. Each row is 4 bytes long, which
means that a block is 16 rows long.

The 4 bytes has these information:

AAAAAAAA BBBBBBBB CCCCCCCC DDDDDDDD

A = Instrument number to use
B = Note (remember to add the transpose value to get the real note)
C = Effect number
D = Effect argument
