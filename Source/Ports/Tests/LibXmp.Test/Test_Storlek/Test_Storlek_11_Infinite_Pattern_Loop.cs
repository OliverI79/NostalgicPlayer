		/// 11 - Infinite loop exploit
		///
		/// (Note: on this test, "fail" status is given for players which
		/// deadlock while loading or calculating the duration, and is not
		/// based on actual playback behavior. Incidentally, this will cause
		/// Impulse Tracker to freeze.)
		///
		/// This is a particularly evil pattern loop setup that exploits two
		/// possible problems at the same time, and it will very likely cause
		/// any player to get "stuck".
		///
		/// The first problem here is the duplicated loopback effect on the
		/// first channel; the correct way to handle this is discussed in the
		/// previous test. The second problem, and quite a bit more difficult
		/// to handle, is the seemingly strange behavior after the third
		/// channel's loop plays once. What happens is the second SB1 in the
		/// first channel "empties" its loopback counter, and when it reaches
		/// the first SB1 again, the value is reset to 1. However, the second
		/// channel hasn't looped yet, so playback returns to the first row.
		/// The next time around, the second channel is done, but the first
		/// one needs to loop again — creating an infinite loop situation.
		/// Even Impulse Tracker gets snagged by this
