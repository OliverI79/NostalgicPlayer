Instruments

 0 4 Mark (inst)
 4 x Volume data commands (from documentation):
     * C0-aa-bb-cc
          aa is the number of the sample (or waveform) used.
             Numbers between 00 and 09 included are samples.
             Numbers between 0A and 33 are waveforms.
          bb is the step to skip waveforms.
             If bb=0 then there is no effect.
             If you want to use a sample, you must set bb to 0.
          cc is the number of waveforms to be played

     * A0-aa-bb-cc: This instruction makes the volume vary.
          aa is the volume at the beginning.
          bb is the volume at the end.
          cc is the length of time to achieve the volume variation.

     * E0-00-00-00: This instruction stops the sound (It cuts the voice).

     * B0-aa-00-00: This instruction is the GOTO or LOOP command.
              It permits to restarts a sound at any step of the volume sequence
              (It's used for echo, make a never-ending sound or restart a
              sound).
              The aa number is the number of the line to reach multiplied by 4.
   4 Mark (insf)
   x Frequency data commands (from documentation):
     * D0-aa-bb-cc: This instruction keeps the frequency constant.
          aa is the offset of the note multiplied by 2 (always even) and it's
             added to the played note. A value of 18 means that the frequency
             is transposed of 1 octave up.
          bb is unused.
          cc is the length of time while the frequency doesn't vary.

     * A0-aa-bb-cc: This instruction makes the frequency vary.
          aa is a value added to the frequency of the note at the beginning.
          bb is a value added to the frequency of the note at the end.
          cc is the number of VBL

     * E0-00-00-00: See above
	 * B0-aa-00-00:
