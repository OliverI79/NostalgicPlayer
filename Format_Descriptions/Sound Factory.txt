  14 100 Subsong information (10 subsongs)
 114     Opcodes


Subsong information (16 bytes each):

 0 4 Offset to first opcode for voice 1
 4 4 Offset to first opcode for voice 2
 8 4 Offset to first opcode for voice 3
 C 4 Offset to first opcode for voice 4


Opcode data:

Keep reading until a note is reached or the voice is made on pause/halt

00-7F Note. Following 16-bit duration
80-FF Opcodes


Opcodes:

80 xxxx           - Pause. xxxx is the duration
81 xx             - Set volume to xx
82 xx             - Set finetune to xx
83 xx             - Set instrument to xx
84 xx yyyy        - Define new instrument for xx. yyyy is the length of instrument data in words starting from the opcode position
85                - Return from subroutine
86 xxxxxxxx       - Jump to subroutine at offset xxxxxxxx relative from current offset
87 xxxxxxxx       - Go to offset xxxxxxxx relative from current offset
88 xx             - For loop. Iterate the next opcodes until Next opcode xx times
89                - Next loop. Jump back to first opcode defined in previous For opcode unless number of times has occurred
8A xx             - Begin to fade out with speed xx
8B                - NOP. Does nothing
8C                - Request. Increment a request value that can be retrieved from the outside
8D                - Loop. Set voice to first opcode defined in subsong
8E                - End. Mute voice and stop parsing
8F xx             - Begin to fade in with speed xx
90 aa dd ss rr    - Set ADSR to given values
91                - One shot. Do not loop sample
92                - Period
93 aa bb cc dd ee - Vibrato. aa means on/off. Only the rest of the arguments are there if on. bb = wait, cc = speed, dd = step, ee = number of steps
94 xx yy          - Arpeggio. xx means on/off. Only the rest of the arguments are there if on. yy = speed
95 aa bb cc dd ee - Phasing. aa means on/off. Only the rest of the arguments are there if on. bb = start, cc = end, dd = speed, ee = step
96 xx yy zz       - Portamento. xx means on/off. Only the rest of the arguments are there if on. yy = speed, zz = step
97 aa bb cc dd    - Tremolo. aa means on/off. Only the rest of the arguments are there if on. bb = speed, cc = step, dd = range
98 aa bb cc dd    - Filter. aa means on/off. Only the rest of the arguments are there if on. bb = frequency, cc = end, dd = speed
99 xxxx           - Stop voice and pause. xxxx is the duration
9A xx             - LED. xx = 00 -> off, else on
9B xx             - Wait until request has reached xx
9C xx             - Set transpose to xx
