Track data:

Each track consist of 2 bytes pair, which are:

0 Block number
1 Transpose value


Block data:

Each block are 64 bytes long. It only contains note information for a single channel. Each row is 4 bytes long, which
means that a block is 16 rows long.

The 4 bytes has these information:

AAAAAAAA BBBBBBBB CCCCCCCC DDDDDDDD

A = Note (remember to add the transpose value to get the real note)
B = Instrument number to use
C = Effect number
D = Effect argument
