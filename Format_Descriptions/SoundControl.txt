Position list information:

Each position is C bytes long. 2 bytes per channel, 6 channels in total.

  0 Track number
  1 ? Only used in player to check for end of song


Track data information:

FF FF       = End of track data
00 xx yy yy = Wait. xx is how many ticks to wait until reading next track command. yy is ignored
nn xx yy zz = If zz is 80, then store note + sample number in list
              nn = Note. First nible octave, second nible note. From 4.0, just a normal index into the period table
              yy = Sample number or from 4.0, instrument number
              zz = Volume

 30 CL Sample commands. Each command consist of 3 16-bit numbers. The command and always two arguments


Commands:

 0     Stop
 1 x   Switch sample to x and update period to current note + new sample transpose
 2 x   Wait x ticks
 3 x   Change hardware sample address to current sample start address + x
 4 x   Switch sample to x and set hardware to sample start address
 5 x   Set hardware length to x (x is in bytes)
 6 x   Switch sample to x and set hardware to sample length
 7 x   Add x to period and set hardware
 8 x   Transpose current note with x and set new hardware period
 9 x   Add x to volume
 A x y Start repeat from next command and change repeat value to y for repeat x
 B x y Add y to repeat value. Repeat if value has not reached x
 C x y Add y to repeat value x
 D x y Set repeat value to y for x
 E     Does nothing
 F     Play current sample (setup hardware)
