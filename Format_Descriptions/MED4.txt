  0    4 ID (MED\x04)
  4    1 Mask bitmask. One bit for each byte. If set, a new mask byte can be read
  5      Sample bitmask. One bit for each sample. If set, some sample information can be read
          0  1 Sample flags (inverted, so 1 means no and 0 means yes (included))

If samples are attached, this folows:

       8 Sample mask. One bit for each sample. If set, sample data is present
         4 Length of sample (SL)
         2 Type
        SL Sample data or synth data depending on the type

After the samples, an IFF like structure follows, with a chunk name and length
       4 Chunk name
       4 Length
         
       Known chunks:

       MEDV
         0 2 ?
         2 1 Major version
         3 1 Minor version

       ANNO
         0 x Null terminated string

       HLDC
	     0 x ??

Block data:

Each block starts with the following structure:

   0   1 Size of block header (BH)
   1   1 Number of tracks
   2   1 Number of rows - 1
   3   2 Block data length (BDL)
   5 (?) Block flag bytes. 1 byte for 64 rows in a block, e.g. if the number of rows is 146, there are 3 bytes stored here
     (?) Line and effect masks

Then the block data itself with BDL number of bytes.
