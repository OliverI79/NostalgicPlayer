   6  2 Start position
   8  2 Stop position

Position information:

Each position contains 4 bytes for each voice. The 4 bytes stands for:

   0  2 Track address
   2  1 Sound transpose
   3  1 Note transpose

Track rows:

All the notes are stored as one big track. The track address in the position
information points to the first row to play at that position.

Each row contains this information:

AAAAAAAA BBBBBBBB CCCCDDDD EEEEEEEE

A = Note (remember to add the transpose value to get the real note)
B = Instrument number to use
C = Arpeggio number
D = Effect number
    0 = No effect
	1 = Slide up/down
	2 = Res. ADSR
	3 = Res. EGC
    4 = Set slide increment
    5 = Set vibrato delay
    6 = Set vibrato position
	7 = Set volume
	8 = Skip NT
	9 = Skip ST
	A = Track len
	B = Skip portamento
	C = ???
	D = ???
	E = Led on/off
	F = Song speed
E = Effect argument


Instrument information:

   0  1 Waveform / sample number
   1  1 Synthesis mode (1 = on, 0 = off)
   2  2 Length of waveform / sample (before loop/oneshot)
