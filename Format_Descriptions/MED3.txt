If samples are attached, this folows:

       4 Sample mask. One bit for each sample. If set, sample data is present
         4 Length of sample (SL)
         2 Type
        SL Sample data

Block data:

Each block starts with the following structure:

   0   1 Number of tracks
   1   1 Block flags
          Bit 0 FirstHalfLineAll
              1 SecondHalfLineAll
              2 FirstHalfEffectAll
              3 SecondHalfEffectAll
              4 FirstHalfLineNone
              5 SecondHalfLineNone
              6 FirstHalfEffectNone
              7 SecondHalfEffectNone
   2   2 Block data length (BDL)
   4 (?) Conversion masks

Then the block data itself with BDL number of bytes.
