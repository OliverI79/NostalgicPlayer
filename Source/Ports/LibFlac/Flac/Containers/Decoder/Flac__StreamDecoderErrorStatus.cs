	/// sync (false synchronization on data that is not the start of a frame)
	/// or corrupted data. The error itself is the decoder's best guess at what
	/// happened assuming a correct sync. For example Bad_Header could be caused
	/// by a correct sync on the start of a frame, but some data in the frame
	/// header was corrupted. Or it could be the result of syncing on a point
	/// the stream that looked like the starting of a frame but was not.
	/// Unparseable_Stream could be because the decoder encountered a valid frame
	/// made by a future version of the encoder which it cannot parse, or because
	/// of a false sync making it appear as though an encountered frame was
	/// generated by a future encoder. Bad_Metadata is
	/// caused by finding data that doesn't fit a metadata block (too large
	/// or too small) or finding inconsistencies in the metadata, for example
	/// a PICTURE block with an image that exceeds the size of the metadata
	/// block
