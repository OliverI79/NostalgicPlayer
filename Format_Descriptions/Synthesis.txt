Position information:

Each position contains 4 bytes for each voice. The 4 bytes stands for:

   0  2 Track address
   2  1 Sound transpose
   3  1 Note transpose

Track rows:

All the notes are stored as one big track. The track address in the position
information points to the first row to play at that position.

Each row contains this information:

AAAAAAAA BBBBBBBB CCCCDDDD EEEEEEEE
